# 👋 Hi, I’m @N3pthys

- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of **computer engineering** and **psychology**. I'm passionate about understanding how technology influences human emotions and behavior, and I'm particularly drawn to projects that apply these insights, from **robotics** to **gaming**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about **quantum computing in cryptography** and building systems for **smart traffic management** and **network analysis** with tools like **Wireshark**. My studies often blend practical, hands-on projects (like my smart robot car) with theoretical exploration.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to:
    - **Machine learning** and **behavioral analysis** for improving online gaming experiences (for example, detecting and mitigating cheating behavior in games like Dota 2).
    - Enhancing **user experiences** in gaming, particularly integrating **music sharing and mood analysis** to optimize gameplay.
    - **Automated systems** like pet feeders and home automation projects.

- ⚡ Fun fact: My Shih Tzu, Jean Paul, is my loyal sidekick in all things tech and adventure! When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me hiking or boxing—or, of course, playing a game of Dota.
